  summary: Saves a list of policy links.
  description: >-
    Replacement for SetPlinks, with added code to detect and prevent situations
    where the action of saving
                the plinks file overwrites changes that have been made by another mechanism.  The Plinks parameter is
                identical to the payload of the SetPlinks API, the RevStamp parameter is new.  If the plinks file has
                been changed since the RevStamp was originally issued then API will return a failure.
