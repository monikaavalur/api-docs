  summary: Resynchronize a TOTP or HOTP token.
  description: |-
    Resynchronizing requires two consecutive token codes
                (which helps to ensure that the caller is in physical possesion of the token, not just of a
                single copied token code).  Assuming that the supplied token codes can be found, TOTP resync
                will compute a new interval delta value that will be stored with the token, and HOTP resync
                will find the matching counter value (always looking forward, never backward) and update
                the counter stored with the token.
                
                Caller must either own the OATH token or be an administrator
