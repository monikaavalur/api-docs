  summary: Get lower case file name.
  description: |-
    Our js files don't match the class names so we get requests for 
                FooBar.js but the file is called foobar.js.
                
                Hence this method (js upload forces all files to lower case too).
                
                vfslow/...... points here
  parameters:
    - name: path
